# Python Games

Just some simple python games I created to learn how to use Pygame. So far I have only made 2 games.

### Sudoku

The Sudoku is fully finished. 
You can play normal sudoku, with all the same game functions, except indexing squares (Small notes).
Additionally by pressing "spacebar" the program will show you a visualization of the [Backtracking Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms)

### Tic-Tac-Toe

Not fully complete.
You can play regularly however it is not very pretty. I have plans to make an AI so that you will never be able to win against the computer, this is a future project.
