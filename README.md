# Python Games

Just some simple python games I created to learn how to use Pygame. All games need the [Pygame Module](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) to be used. Additional modules will be stated under the respectice games.

### Sudoku

The Sudoku is fully finished. 

You can play normal sudoku, with all the same game functions, except indexing squares (Small notes).
Additionally by pressing "spacebar" the program will show you a visualization of the [Backtracking Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms)

### Snake

Snake is fully finished. *Requires random, and time module*

You can play normal snake, with all the same game functions.
Additionally by pressing "spacebar" the program will begin auto "solving" the snake game, that is it will perform the guarenteed winning strategy using a [Hamiltonian Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path). This is absoulutely not the most efficient strategy, perhaps a future project?

### Tic-Tac-Toe

Not fully complete.

You can play regularly however it is not very pretty. I have plans to make an AI so that you will never be able to win against the computer, this is a future project.
